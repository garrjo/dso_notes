    "question": "How is DSO different from other \"theories of everything\"?",
    "category": "methodology",
    "answer": "DSO inverts the ontological stack. Standard physics treats spacetime, particles, and forces as primitives and tries to unify them. DSO posits Energy as the sole primitive — spacetime, particles, and forces are derived structures. It's not a modification of existing theories; it's a different answer to \"what exists fundamentally.\" Most ToE attempts add complexity; DSO subtracts assumptions.",

    "question": "Why should I trust derivations over measurements?",
    "category": "methodology",
    "answer": "You shouldn't trust blindly — you should verify. DSO derives values (like ℏ), then compares to measurements. If they match, the derivation is validated. If they don't, DSO is falsified. The point isn't \"derivation beats measurement\" — it's that derivability reveals whether a constant is fundamental or emergent. Measurement tells you what; derivation tells you why.",

One validity criterion: scale invariance — the same relationships hold from Planck to cosmic scales.

    "answer": "MOND modifies Newtonian dynamics with an acceleration threshold (a₀). It's a phenomenological fix — it describes rotation curves but doesn't explain why a₀ exists. DSO derives rotation curves from density geometry with zero free parameters. MOND asks \"what if gravity changes at low acceleration?\" DSO asks \"what if 'missing mass' is a category error?\" MOND modifies; DSO reframes.",

DSO eliminates spacetime as primitive entirely — it emerges from Energy's D·S·O structure. The mathematical formalisms share no ancestry. If you see overlap, it's because they're all attempting to solve the same problems, not because DSO derives from them.",

Boltzmann's statistical mechanics, Wegener's continental drift, and Einstein's 1905 papers all faced initial silence or dismissal. DSO inverts primitives — it doesn't fit existing categories (not a GR modification, not a quantum interpretation, not alternative cosmology).

Mass is high-D stable S with fixed O. Light is low-D propagating O oscillation. Gravity is D-gradient effect on S·O geometry.

D·S·O structure is inherently recursive (structures within structures at all scales). φ-geometry is the unique scaling solution for self-similar systems. It's not numerology — it's the mathematical consequence of scale invariance. φ appears because the universe is self-similar, not because the number is mystical.",
